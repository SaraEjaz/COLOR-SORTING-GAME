## 📖 Introduction

The *Color Sorting Game* invites players to sort colored elements (`R`, `G`, `B`, `Y`) into their respective stacks or queues. Players navigate increasing levels of difficulty, making decisions to efficiently organize elements within a limited number of moves. Each level introduces new rules and mechanics, offering a unique challenge.

## 🔍 Implemented Concepts & Data Structures

* **Arrays** – Store colors and containers
* **Stacks** – Manage LIFO-based sorting containers
* **Queues** – Implement FIFO container logic (Level 3)
* **Randomization** – Generate unpredictable color sequences
* **Loops & Conditionals** – Drive the game flow and decisions
* **Scoring System** – Based on efficient sorting and move limits
* **Error Handling** – Guide users on invalid input or container limits

## 🎮 Project Features

### 🧾 Game Instructions Display

* Rules shown at the start of each level
* Clear color codes (`R`, `G`, `B`, `Y`), container types, and scoring info

### 🧱 Dynamic Levels

* Level 1: Basic sorting with fixed stacks
* Level 2: Introduces move limits and scoring
* Level 3: Includes queues and power containers

### 🧩 Color Sorting Gameplay

* Players choose where to place colors using stack or queue selection
* Use logic to sort correctly in minimal moves

### ⛔ Limited Moves & Scoring

* Tracks moves and rewards efficient gameplay
* Penalties for invalid input or poor choices

### 🔁 Replay & Completion

* Option to replay same level or restart game
* Congratulatory message upon successful sorting
